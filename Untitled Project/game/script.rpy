    "Failure."
    "Failure was everything it was inside my head, as the moon casts my shadow on the sidewalk to my way home."

    y "Sigh..."
    y "When it will just finish? It seems like my finals will last for a while..."
    "I murmur to myself as I walk."
    "A few hours ago, I was in the examination room alone because everyone in my class passed.  Like I would care."
    "I handed over the empty exam paper and headed home without any care in the world."
    "Maybe I didnâ€™t have to play the new released game until morning."
    "It was getting late and the moon is getting brighter and brighter as I distance myself from my school."
    "I had to move quick or I would be late for the in-game event."

    "As i keep going, i notice small droplets of blood on the ground."
    "As i walked more and more the droplets would become bigger and bigger where they lead to a back alley"
    "Scared and curious at the same time, armed with a cutter knife that i forgot to give back to the class rep. I let my feet go forward"

    "i look in every direction with every step i make and on the corner behind a big pile of trash bags, i see a body could barely move"
    "I lastly check the area around one more time and go to the body"
    "Lastly, for my own safety, i prepare the knife towards the body if something would happen."
    scene bg_back_alley_girl_wonded
    "The body was of a young girl, with messy black hair and bloody clothes. I listen to heartbeat if she was still alive."
    "I could hear a very weak heartbeat that would slowly decrease and increase the beats per minute. I put down my bag and take my half-full
    bottle of water and open it. I open her mouth and give her a little bit of water, but not too much to make her suffocate."
    "I splash a bit of water on her face and take off my shirt and salvage it to make shift bandages. i carefully roll the bandages on her shoulder,
    it was a deep cut so I placed the bandages."
    "Last of all, I took my phone out of my pocket and decided to call the emergency service. As soon as i would press the button to begin the call,
    her hand grabbed my forearm, I could hear a very faint voice."
