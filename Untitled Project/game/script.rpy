    "Failure."
    "Failure was everything it was inside my head, as the moon casts my shadow on the sidewalk to my way home."

    y "Sigh..."
    y "When it will just finish? It seems like my finals will last for a while..."
    "I murmur to myself as I walk."
    "A few hours ago, I was in the examination room alone because everyone in my class passed.  Like I would care."
    "I handed over the empty exam paper and headed home without any care in the world."
    "Maybe I didnâ€™t have to play the new released game until morning."
    "It was getting late and the moon is getting brighter and brighter as I distance myself from my school."
    "I had to move quick or I would be late for the in-game event."
    "..."

    "As i keep going, i notice small droplets of blood on the ground."
    "As i walked more and more the droplets would become bigger and bigger where they lead to a back alley"
    "Scared and curious at the same time, armed with a cutter knife that i forgot to give back to the class rep. I let my feet go forward"

    "i look in every direction with every step i make and on the corner behind a big pile of trash bags, i see a body could barely move"
    "I lastly check the area around one more time and go to the body"
    "Lastly, for my own safety, i prepare the knife towards the body if something would happen."
    scene bg_back_alley_girl_wonded
    "The body was of a young girl, with messy black hair and bloody clothes. I listen to heartbeat if she was still alive."
    "I could hear a very weak heartbeat that would slowly decrease and increase the beats per minute. I put down my bag and take my half-full
    bottle of water and open it. I open her mouth and give her a little bit of water, but not too much to make her suffocate."
    "I splash a bit of water on her face and take off my shirt and salvage it to make shift bandages. i carefully roll the bandages on her shoulder,
    it was a deep cut so I placed the bandages."
    "Last of all, I took my phone out of my pocket and decided to call the emergency service. As soon as i would press the button to begin the call,
    her hand grabbed my forearm, I could hear a very faint voice."

    "As soon as possible I gave her some water to drink by opening her mouth gently."
    y "B..but why? You get wounded, didn't you ?"
    "There was no answer from her still I said to her if she was hungry, finally, she nodded her little head."
    "At school I planned not to eat my lunch, but because of the boredom of waiting outside of examination, I ate it."
    "Damn my bad luck is hitting at the wrong time again. Just how bad can it be?"
    "I told the girl that I'll find some food to eat and not to move even one inch. But when I came back, she was nowhere to be found."
    "I question myself if I was hallucinating because I did'nt sleep last night due to too much item farming."
    "I look back at the drops of blood on the sidewalk, but they vanished, the rain washed them away."
    "Thinking it was just imaginaton, I decide to walk home"

    "I arrive home late, tired, all my body including my backpack was wet. I pulled out everthing from my backpack and prepared to take a bath."
    "I let my clothes dry on the dryind racket and head off to the bathroom. A few minutes passes by and I let my mind wash away everything that
    happened today."
    "As i pull out the drain from the bathtub, I take my pajamas and head off to bed."

    "With clouds"
    "In a few hours the awaited game event will start so, I'll rest for a while. As i closed my eyes, I could hear some footsteps outside my house."
    "Firstly, I though they were some delinquent kids walking by, but the footsteps wouldn't stop. Grapping my cutter again and my sleepers then I head outside."
    "Silent.."
    "I open the door and look left either right carefully. There was nothing, I walk to the back of my house to make sure everything is alright.
    It's such a relief to see no one there."
    y " I think i hallucinated enough for today. I don't even care at this point already."
    "I close the door and head off to bed again. But as I think back...the door handle... was a bit warm..."

    "The sun rays entered my room and hit my eyes."
    "I woke up."
    "I look at the watch on my wrist with a long gasp."
    y "NO WAY I SLEPT-F***"
    "It seems I missed my awaited 1-year event. My bad luck hit again, I sighed for the last time."
    "Even if I sigh thousands times more, it'll not help with anything at this point. Well since I've missed it, I'll sleep more then."
    scene bg_living-room
    "Suddenly, my phone made a sound again after i didn't hear for a long time. It was the notification sound, being already pissed
    and nervous."
    " I open it which would prompt me to a text message from an unknown number."
    " The following was:'Meet me. We need to talk. NOW' There was attached some GPS Coordinates."
    "Thinking it was another spam text or accidental texting, I ignore it. The next minute I receive a text message from that
    unknown number, again."
    "'Meet me. Yuuto Makoto' I got a chill down my spine"
